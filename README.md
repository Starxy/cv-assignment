# Computer Vision Course Assignments

This repository contains all materials related to Shandong Normal University Computer Vision course assignments, including source code, datasets, and experimental reports.

## Course Structure

The course consists of four main components:

### 1. Image Classification (Assignment 1)

- Implemented LeNet and ResNet from scratch
- Compared training performance of LeNet vs ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 on Fashion-MNIST dataset
- Recorded training process and loss curves

### 2. Object Detection (Assignment 2)

- Implemented a simplified SSD network
- Tested object detection on a custom banana dataset
- Recorded training process and loss curves

### 3. Image Restoration (Assignment 3)

- Implementation of Noise2Noise

### 4. Final Project

- Researched mainstream edge-side face detection models like BlazeFace, RetinaFace, YOLOv5-Face, YuNet etc.
- Used ONNX format and ONNX Runtime to benchmark model inference speed, model size, accuracy and robustness
